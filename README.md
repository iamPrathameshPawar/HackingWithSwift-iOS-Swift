This consist of the Small mini-projects to get my hands-on new and rare concepts which I don't really use in daily developement at my work, but necessary for me to have them on my resume. 
As this repo focuses mostly on getting me ready and work on new concepts, I have not added the screenshots for the Mini-projects.
